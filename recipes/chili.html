    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Here is an image of delicious turkey chili.</p>
    <p>This turkey chili recipe is very simple 
        but hearty with plenty of flavors â€” it's even better on the second day! 
        I serve this chili with low-fat Cheddar cheese and low-fat sour cream.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Turkey: </strong>This simple turkey chili starts with a pound of ground turkey cooked in olive oil.</li>
        <li><Strong>Canned Vegetables: </Strong>You'll need canned crushed tomatoes and canned kidney beans.</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic: </strong>A tablespoon of fresh garlic adds bold flavor and depth.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices: </strong>The turkey chill is spiced with chili powder, paprika, dried oregano, cayenne pepper, cumin, salt, and black pepper.</li>

    </ul>
